How to navigate this repository

- All required materials are saved in the root directory. “Backpropagation Note” and “Backpropagation Slides” are documentation including notes and slides respectively. “Backpropagation Quiz Solution” includes the quiz questions, and the solutions to these questions are left in blue. For the coding assignment, there’s “Backpropagation Coding Assignment Blank” and “Backpropagation Coding Assignment Solution”. There’s no extra dataset.

Learning objectives

- We teach backpropagation in week 5. We introduced backprop as a way to train a neural network to find the optimal weights. At this point, students have been exposed to in 16B and previous weeks of 16ML the meaning of weights. In linear and logistic regression, we find the optimal weights, except in logistic it was through optimization. So these ideas have been introduced. With backprop, we are formalising this for the purpose of neural networks, to get the gradient for each weight.

- Notes and slides lay the theoretical groundwork of neural networks, and motivating the purpose of using backpropagation (to optimize the weights in a neural machine with many weights). We provide an overview of the neural network, including the structure, and the forward pass, as this will help students understand the backward pass. Then we explain the chain rule, which leads into a simple example of the backpropagation method on a small network.

- Quiz questions are about enforcing the backpropagation mechanism in the context of a classification problem, as well as in a more complex model with two hidden layers.
